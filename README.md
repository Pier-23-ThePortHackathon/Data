- Inside Data/Tremors you'll find the sensor data of Kitti and Lars while they wore the device for two nights.

The data from the sensors comes split into several LOG*.TXT files. There is also one .csv file in each subfolder containing the complete dataset.

The ipython notebook contains a spectral analysis of the tremor data.
